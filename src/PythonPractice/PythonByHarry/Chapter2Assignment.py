# 1 write a python program to add two number

# num1 = int(input("Enter first Number: "))
# num2 = int(input("Enter second Number: "))

# print(f"Sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num2+num1}")


# 2 & 3 write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z

# num = input("Enter number: ")
# print(type (num))
# div = int(input("Enter number to division: "))
# num = int(num)
# print(type(num))

# print(num%div)


#4  use comprasion operator to find out wheater a given variable is greater than b or not, Take a = 34 and b = 80

# a = 34
# b = 80

# if a > b:
#     print(f"{a} is greater.")
# else:
#     print(f"{b} is greater.")


# 5 write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by user.

# num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
# num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# print((num1+num2)/2)

# 6 write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by user.

num = int(input("Enter your Number: "))
print(num**2)
